This project started as a Secure Software Process class assignment, coding a Rubik's Cube solver that takes in a 54 character string representing some cube where each character is a square on each face (9 squares x 6 faces). It then calculates the rotations necessary to solve the given cube.

Example Cube: 

`rrrybbybbggwrrrrrroooggwggwybboooooogggyyyyyybwwbwwbww`

Example Solution: 

`LFFRRbbFFRRBBLLbuBbuBUURUruubuBuruRfuFfuFUUluLURUrUufuFURUruuuruRUBUbbuBULUluuubuBULUlFURurfFURurfUUFURurfRUrURUUrRUrURUUrUUURUrURUUrRUrURUUrRUrURUUrUUUlURuLUrRUrURUUruuuuuFFULrFFlRUFFuu`

## How It Works

A Rubik's Cube can be solved using various algorithms. I chose a standard algorithm that solves the bottom layer up to the top.
